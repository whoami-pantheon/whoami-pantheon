Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) My name is Clive Akporube

Bearer of Subtle Chaos
----------------------

I focus on adversary simulation, human attack surfaces, and the failure modes that emerge when systems "work".

I design security and technology as systems that must survive contact with real users, real incentives, real adversaries, and inform strategic decisions.

I write code the way people follow maps; noticing the gaps, tracing the edges, seeing what folds back on itself.

Projects layer in corners of curiosity; half experiments, the rest solutions, each leaving a faint echo.

I break things to understand them. I refactor to see their limits.

Sometimes I drink coffee, sometimes I let the system tell me its own story.

You’ll notice odd habits... folders named after forgotten thoughts, commits that read like whispers, patterns that only make sense after you’ve stepped away.

Everything here exists somewhere between precision and chaos, between what works and what forces you to look twice.
