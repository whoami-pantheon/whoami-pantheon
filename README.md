Hi! ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)   My name is Clive Akporube

Bearer of Subtle Chaos
----------------------

I build architectures that survive contact with the real world: real users, real incentives, and real adversaries, and inform strategic decisions. I trace patterns and show the failure modes that emerge when systems "work".

* **Specialties:** Adversary simulation, human attack surfaces, security strategy, systems thinking.

* **Current Engine(s):**
   * [**BlackMorror**](https://github.com/whoami-pantheon/BlackMorror) - Hyper-realistic adversary simulation engine identifying security gaps before they manifest (A mirror of adversarial thought).
   * **HASIx (Human Attack Suface Index)** - A quantitative framework for measuring human attack surface at individual and organizational levels.
   * **Oracle** - A behavioral engine that maps public trails into the specific moment a structure’s human layer will fail.

* **Philosophy:**   Code like a map; Notice the gaps, trace the edges, understand how the engine folds back on itself.

Here, you'll notice the unusual is standard:

* Commits read like scars; Each one a lesson in what the core tried to reject.

* Architecture is memory; If you do not account for the ghost in the machine, it will eventually drive the vehicle.

* and experiments become tools; accidents become variables to be harnessed.

Everything exists in the tension between precision and chaos. Between what works and what forces you to look twice.

If you linger here long enough, you’ll notice odd habits: the way behavior leaves fingerprints in the system, the way choices leave invisible trails, the way rules bend without breaking.

In this space, systems remember what you forget.

* 🤝  I'm open to collaborating on work that challenge the symmetry of power, uncovers hidden patterns, or leave a permanent mark on the infrastructure of the real.
* ⚡   Observing the ways human behaviour, machine intelligence, and security protocols influence one another.
